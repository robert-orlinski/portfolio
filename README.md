# (Still) valid portfolio

One of my first HTML, CSS, JS projects - a portfolio which accompanied me when I was searching for my first jobs as a freelancer.

A lot has changed since then but repo still exists and doing its job. It is not as bad as I could expect after about 3 years so I leave it just here.
